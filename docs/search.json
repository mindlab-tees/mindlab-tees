By measuring changes in blood oxygenation, we can identify brain regions that are involved in risk perception and decision-making, and study how these processes are linked to hypomania. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior in hypomania, and to identify potential targets for intervention."

I am particularly interested in economic decision-making, which includes topics such as gambling. I am also interested in the application of neuroeconomic approaches to understanding decision-making in other domains, such as clinical psychology.\nIn the lab, I use fNIRS, Eyetracking, Virtual Reality and web-based experimental approaches in this work. I use R for data analysis and jsPsych for coding experiments."

I am also interested in the effects of individual differences and contextual factors on language processing. Much of my research is experimental and lab-based. The experiments that we conduct in the MIND lab are computer-based cognition, language processing, memory, and learning studies."

    "text": "Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygenation. fNIRS is based on the principle that when a brain region is activated, blood flow to that region increases, leading to an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. fNIRS uses near-infrared light to measure these changes in blood oxygenation, allowing researchers to study brain function in real-time.\n\n\nWe use fnirs to examine brain activity during various cognitive tasks, such as working memory, attention, and decision-making. By measuring changes in blood oxygenation, we can identify brain regions that are involved in these tasks and study how they interact with each other. fNIRS is particularly well-suited for studying brain function over time, and can be used to track changes in brain activity during the course of a task or intervention.\n\n\n\nWe currently use an FNIR400 from Biopac Systems Inc. which is a continuous wave system. We use a 16-channel headband to measure changes in blood oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region that is involved in a wide range of cognitive functions."
