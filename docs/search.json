By measuring changes in blood oxygenation, we can identify brain regions that are involved in risk perception and decision-making, and study how these processes are linked to hypomania. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior in hypomania, and to identify potential targets for intervention."
