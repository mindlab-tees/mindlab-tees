## Project Overview
This project seeks to understand risk-taking in hypomania through the application of cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economic approaches.

We are particularly interested how risk-perception, reward sensitivity, and decision-making processes are linked to hypomania, and how these alterations contribute to the development of risky behaviors.

We use functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine brain activity during risk-taking tasks. By measuring changes in blood oxygenation, we can identify brain regions that are involved in risk perception and decision-making, and study how these processes are linked to hypomania. Our goal is to develop a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior in hypomania, and to identify potential targets for intervention.
