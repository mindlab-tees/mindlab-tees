This workshop will provide an introduction to Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood oxygenation. fNIRS is based on the principle that when a brain region is activated, blood flow to that region increases, leading to an increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. fNIRS uses near-infrared light to measure these changes in blood oxygenation, allowing researchers to study brain function in real-time.

## Workshop Outline

1. What is fNIRS?
2. Setting up an fNIRS experiment
3. Data acquisition
4. Exporting data
